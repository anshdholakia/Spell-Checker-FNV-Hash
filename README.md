This repository contains the files required for the spellchecking program.
It uses hash tables as the primary data structure to store the dictionary elements, look for the misspelled words, and find its alternatives.
I have used the Fowler-Noll-Vo hash function which can be used for hashing strings. {https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%E2%80%93Noll%E2%80%93Vo_hash_function}
